# alanwsmith.com Dead Link Finder

The blog form of my site has existed since 2005.
I've never really gone back and cleaned up dead
links. That's what this process is for.

In addition to finding dead links, it produces
a little report about what it found. Something
to play around with and see if there's any
interesting analytics that come out of it.
