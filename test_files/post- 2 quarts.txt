A relatively slow way to set money aside. Throw all your loose
change in a bottle. For example a 2 quart juice bottle.

A friend of mine told me that some banks will take change without
requiring you to roll it up first. Sure enough, my bank does this,
and there's no percentage charge like the change machines at
grocery stores. You also get a decent workout lugging the thing
into the bank. Two quarts of metal weighs a fair amount.
